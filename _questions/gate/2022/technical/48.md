Let G (V, E) be a directed graph, where V = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} is the set of vertices and E is the set of directed edges, as defined by the following adjacency matrix A.

$$
A [i][j] = \left\{\begin{matrix} 1, & 1 \leq j \leq i \leq 5 \\ 0, & \text{otherwise}\end{matrix}\right.
$$

A[i][j]=1 indicates a directed edge from node i to node j. A directed spanning tree of G rooted at $r \in V$, is defined as a subgraph T of G such that the undirected version of T is a tree, and T contains a directed path from r to every other vertex in V. The number of such directed spanning trees rooted at vertex 5 is __________________.
