Consider a digital display system (DDS) shown in the figure that displays the contents of register X. A 16-bit code word is used to load a word in X, either from S or from R. S is a 1024-word memory segment and R is a 32-word register file. Based on the value of mode bit M, T selects an input word to load in X. P and Q interface with the corresponding bits in the code word to choose the addressed word. Which one of the following represents the functionality of P, Q, and T?
