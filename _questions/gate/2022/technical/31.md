Consider three floating-point numbers A, B, and C stored in registers RA, RB, and RC, respectively as per IEEE-754 single-precision floating-point format. The 32-bit content stored in these registers (in hexadecimal form) is as follows.

$$\begin{array} {|c|c|c|} \hline \text{R}_{\text{A}} = \text{0xC1400000} & \text{R}_{\text{B}} = \text{0x42100000} & \text{R}_{\text{C}} = \text{0x41400000} \\\hline \end{array}$$
