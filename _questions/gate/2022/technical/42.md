option_a: The diagonal entries of $A^2$ are the degrees of the vertices of the graph. 
option_b: If the graph is connected, then none of the entries of $A^{n-1} + I_n can be zero.
option_c: If the sum of all the elements of A is at most 2(n-1), then the graph must be acyclic.
option_d: If there is at least a 1 in each of A’s rows and columns, then the graph must be connected.
