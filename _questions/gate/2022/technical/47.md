Consider a network with three routers P, Q, R shown in the figure below. All the links have cost of unity

![GATE 2022 Set 1 Q47](/assets/images/gate-exams/2022-1-14.png)

The routers exchange distance vector routing information and have converged on the routing tables, after which the link Qâˆ’R fails. Assume that P and Q send out routing updates at random times, each at the same average rate. The probability of a routing loop formation (rounded off to one decimal place) between P and Q, leading to count-to-infinity problem, is___________.
