option_a: The edge with the second smallest weight is always part of any minimum spanning tree of G .
option_b: One or both of the edges with the third smallest and the fourth smallest weights are part of any minimum spanning tree of G .
option_c: Suppose S C V be such that S ≠∅ and S ≠ V . Consider the edge with the minimum weight such that one of its vertices is in S and the other in V \ S . Such an edge will always be part of any minimum spanning tree of G
option_d: G can have multiple minimum spanning trees
answer: abc
