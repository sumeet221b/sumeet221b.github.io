Let r be a root of the equation $x^{2} + 2x + 6 = 0.$

Then the value of the expression $(r+2) (r+3) (r+4) (r+5)$ is

{% contentfor explaination %}
- Speed of car A = 50 km/hr
- Speed of car B = 60 km/hr

Since, both cars A and B are moving in same direction, the relative speed = **60 â€“ 50 = 10 km/hr**

Distance required between them = 20 km

$$\therefore Time = \frac{Distance}{Time} = \frac{20}{10} = 2 hrs$$
