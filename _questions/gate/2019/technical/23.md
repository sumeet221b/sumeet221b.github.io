Consider three concurrent processes P1, P2, and P3 as shown below, which access a shared variable D that has been initialized to 100.

$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline P_1 & P_2 & P_3 \\ \hline  : & : & :  \\  : & : & :  \\  D=D+20 & D=D-50 & D=D+10 \\ : & : &  :  \\ : & : & :  \\ \hline \end{array}
$$

The processes are executed on a uniprocessor system running a time-shared operating system. If the minimum and maximum possible values of D after the three processes have completed execution are X and Y respectively, then the value of Y  - X is ______
