Assume that in a certain computer, the virtual addresses are 64 bits long and the physical addresses are 48 bits long. The memory is word addressable. The page size is 8 kB and the word size is 4 bytes. The Transwerlation Look-aside Buffer (TLB) in the address transwerlation path has 128 valid entries. At most how many distinct virtual addresses can be transwerlated without any TLB miss?
