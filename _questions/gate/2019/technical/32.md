Let the set of functional dependencies *F = {QR → S, R → P, S → Q}* hold on a relation schema *X = (PQRS)*. *X* is not in BCNF. Suppose *X* is decomposed into two schemas *Y* and *Z*, where *Y = (PR)* and *Z = (QRS)*. 

Consider the two statements given below

I. Both Y and Z are in BCNF.<br>
II. ecomposition of X into Y and Z is dependency preserving and lossless.

Which of the above statements is/are correct?
