option_a: $X_p + X_q < \text{Min} \{Y_k \mid 1 \leq k \leq n, k \neq p, k \neq q \}$
option_b: $X_p + X_q < \text{Max} \{Y_k \mid 1 \leq k \leq n, k \neq p, k \neq q \}$
option_c: $\text{Min}(X_p,X_q) \geq \text{Min} \{Y_k \mid 1 \leq k \leq n, k \neq p, k \neq q\}$

Consider the following snapshot of a system running n concurrent processes. Process i is holding 𝑋i instances of a resource R, 1 ≤ i ≤ n. Assume that all instances of R are currently in use. Further, for all i, process i can place a request for at most Yi additional instances of R while holding the 𝑋i instances it already has. Of the n processes, there are exactly two processes *p* and *q* such that *Yp* = *Yq* = 0. Which one of the following conditions guarantees that no other process apart from *p* and *q* can complete execution?
