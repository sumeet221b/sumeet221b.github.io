Three of the five students allocated to a hostel put in special requests to the warden. Given the floor plan of the vacant rooms, select the allocation plan that will accommodate all their requests.
- Request by X: Due to pollen allergy, I want to avoid a wing next to the garden.
- Request by Y: I want to live as far from the washrooms as possible, since I am very sensitive to smell.
- Request by Z: I believe in Vaastu and so want to stay in the South-west wing.

The shaded rooms are already occupied. WR is washroom.
