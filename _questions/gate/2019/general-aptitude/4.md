Ten friends planned to share equally the cost of buying a gift for their teacher. When two of them decided not to contribute, each of the other friends had to pay Rs 150 more. The cost of the gift was Rs. ____.

{% contentfor explaination %}
Let share of each student = a

Total cost of gift = 10 $\times$ a

x = 8(a + 150)

x = 600

Total cost = 10 Ã— 600 = 6000
