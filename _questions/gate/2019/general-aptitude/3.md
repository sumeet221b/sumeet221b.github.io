Two cars start at the same time from the same location and go in the same direction. The
speed of the first car is 50 km/h and the speed of the second car is 60 km/h. The number of
hours it takes for the distance between the two cars to be 20 km is ___.

{% contentfor explaination %}
- Speed of car A = 50 km/hr
- Speed of car B = 60 km/hr

Since, both cars A and B are moving in same direction, the relative speed = **60 â€“ 50 = 10 km/hr**

Distance required between them = 20 km

$$\therefore Time = \frac{Distance}{Time} = \frac{20}{10} = 2 hrs$$
